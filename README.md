# FFT

Fast Fourier Transform implementation in Python. I compared the classic FFT implementation with the one available in the FFTPACK package. I also presented how to use vectorization to speed up calculations. Unfortunately, even using this method I didn't get close to the calculation speed in NumPy pack.
